# i10br | I-10 Baton Rouge

 The exhibits represented the best information available at that time during Louisiana DOTD's Stage 1 Environmental study. The overall project has since been subdivided into sections to be constructed independently under individual contracts and budgets. The first - Segment 1 - has (2023) initiated construction as a Construction Manager At Risk (CMAR) project and work is underway. Segment 1 is essentially represented by Sheets #5 and #6 of these exhibits. Please note that the engineer's construction plans viewable here have changed during the intervening years, as additional data (such as land surveys) and design decisions were made by the Agency.
